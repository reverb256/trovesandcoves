# Troves & Coves - Crystal Jewelry Showcase

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A modern crystal jewelry showcase platform built with React, TypeScript, and Cloudflare Workers.

## 🌟 What This Is

This is a **static showcase site** for Troves & Coves crystal jewelry with:
- Beautiful product catalog with Material You-inspired design
- Serverless API backend (Cloudflare Workers)
- Basic cart functionality (localStorage)
- Etsy integration for purchases
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## ⚠️ What This Is Not (Yet)

To be transparent: this is **not currently a full e-commerce platform**. The following features are planned but not implemented:
- ❌ No real database (uses in-memory storage)
- ❌ No payment processing (redirects to Etsy)
- ❌ No user authentication
- ❌ No admin dashboard
- ❌ No AI features (were removed in earlier commit)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned improvements.

## 🎨 Design System

The app uses a Material You-inspired design system with a cream color scheme:
- Design tokens in `shared/locked-design-language.ts`
- Tailwind classes: `bg-surface-50`, `text-on-surface-variant`, etc.
- shadcn/ui components for base UI elements
